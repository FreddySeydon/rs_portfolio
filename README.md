## Welcome

This is my portfolio website that I will use to apply for jobs as a Web- and App-Developer.
Feel free to get inspired by this.

## Setup
This portfolio is made in next.js 14.0.4 in 2023.
I bootstrapped this project with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and deleted all the parts that I didn't need.
